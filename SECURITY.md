## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Use strong, unique passwords
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=use-strong-random-password
SECRET_KEY=generate-cryptographically-secure-key
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=use-bcrypt-hashed-password

# Enable security features
AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED=true
MULTI_USER_MODE=true
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # Avoid DEBUG in production
```

#### Network Security
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security settings
services:
  web-interface:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=50m
```

#### Firewall Configuration
```bash
# Only expose necessary ports
ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP (redirects to HTTPS)
ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
ufw deny 8081/tcp   # Block external Traefik dashboard access
```

### Operational Security

#### Regular Updates
- **Container Images**: Regularly update base images
- **Dependencies**: Keep Python packages updated
- **Host System**: Apply security patches promptly

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Log Analysis**: Monitor for suspicious activities
- **Certificate Expiry**: Set up alerts for expiring certificates
- **Failed Logins**: Monitor authentication failures
- **Resource Usage**: Track unusual resource consumption

## 🔍 Security Scanning

### Automated Scanning
We use multiple security scanning tools:

- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for vulnerability detection
- **Dependency Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
